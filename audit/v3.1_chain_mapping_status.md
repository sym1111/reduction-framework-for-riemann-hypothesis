# v3.1 Paper-to-Lean Chain Mapping Status

This note records the current mapping between the v3.1 manuscript route and the
public Lean snapshot. It is intentionally explicit about what is fully
mechanized versus what is still represented by external or bridge assumptions.

## Paper Route (v3.1)

Core classical-mass branch in manuscript:

1. `prop:R1_classical_mass`
   - `A_Reduction_Framework_RH_v3.1.tex:4633`
2. `prop:R1_classical_mass_applicability`
   - `A_Reduction_Framework_RH_v3.1.tex:4651`
3. `thm:R1-limit-point`
   - `A_Reduction_Framework_RH_v3.1.tex:4672`
   - uses classical mass branch at `A_Reduction_Framework_RH_v3.1.tex:4705`
4. RH closure call path
   - `A_Reduction_Framework_RH_v3.1.tex:1002`
   - RH conclusion statement at `A_Reduction_Framework_RH_v3.1.tex:1023`

## Lean Mapping (public snapshot)

### External axis

- Single explicit external axiom:
  - `audit/formalization/lean_v3_1/LeanV31/R1CitationStandardChain.lean:27`
  - name: `paper_external_mass_divergence_limitpoint`

### Classical-mass route wrappers

- `R1_classical_mass`:
  - `audit/formalization/lean_v3_1/LeanV31/R1ClassicalMass.lean:13`
- `R1_classical_mass_applicability`:
  - `audit/formalization/lean_v3_1/LeanV31/R1ClassicalMassApplicability.lean:15`
- `R1_limit_point`:
  - `audit/formalization/lean_v3_1/LeanV31/R1LimitPoint.lean:15`
- paper-facing chain wrapper:
  - `audit/formalization/lean_v3_1/LeanV31/R1CitationStandardChain.lean:1`

### RH closure modules

- `rh_from_lstar`:
  - `audit/formalization/lean_v3_1/LeanV31/RHFromLstar.lean:80`
- `reverse_RH`:
  - `audit/formalization/lean_v3_1/LeanV31/ReverseRH.lean:49`
- `final_bridge_closed`:
  - `audit/formalization/lean_v3_1/LeanV31/FinalBridgeClosed.lean:38`

## Build/Proof Hygiene Snapshot

- `lake build` status: pass (public snapshot buildable)
- explicit `axiom` count in `LeanV31/*.lean`: 1
- `sorry`/`admit`: none detected in `LeanV31/*.lean`

## Remaining Upgrade Targets

1. Replace bridge-parameter wrappers with fully internal proofs where possible.
2. Strengthen the R1-collapse-to-RH integration path as a direct theorem layer.
3. Reduce modeling shortcuts where definitions are intentionally compressed.
4. Keep external dependence and claim boundaries explicit in release notes.

## Recommended Public Statement

The preprint and Lean formalization are under active refinement. The repository
maintains reproducible builds, theorem-to-code mapping, and transparent status
tracking for remaining bridge-to-internal-proof upgrades.
