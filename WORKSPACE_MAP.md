# Workspace Map

- Active manuscript:
  - `A_Reduction_Framework_RH_v2.11.tex` (current)
  - `A_Reduction_Framework_RH_v2.10.tex` (stable baseline)
- Core folders:
  - `audit/` checks, reports, diagnostics
  - `formal_checks/` Lean/Coq checks
  - `data/` runtime/config data files
  - `tools/` helper scripts
  - `notes/` free-form notes and assets
  - `archive/` legacy versions and non-active documents

- Reorganization log:
  - `audit/workspace_reorg_2026-02-08.csv`

- Rule of thumb:
  - Keep only active files at root.
  - Put new drafts/versions under `archive/tex_versions` unless promoted to active.
  - Put exploratory text notes under `notes/raw`.
